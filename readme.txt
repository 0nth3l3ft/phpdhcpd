Thank you for downloading this program!

phpdhcpd provides a nice online interface for viewing
the file /var/lib/dhcp3/dhcpd.leases file.  This file
contains all the information regarding a DHCP server
and the IP addresses that it has allocated to users.

Installation is pretty simple.  Just copy the folder
to where you want it in your "www" directory in apache.

Edit the "config.php" file.

Now just navigate to your website and that directory.
It should come up and display the information.
